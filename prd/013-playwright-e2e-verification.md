## Overview

- Runs Playwright end-to-end tests to verify flows and capture failures.
- Iterates on fixes based on test results.

## Requirements

- Run Playwright tests for all relevant flows (collection view, notifications, navigation).
- Capture any test failures and iterate on fixes as needed.
- Ensure all tests pass before marking as complete.
- Add or update unit/integration tests as required by fixes.

## Acceptance

- All Playwright tests pass for relevant flows.
- Any failures are captured and resolved.
- All tests pass and coverage is maintained.

- [ ] Ensure all documentation (`SPEC.md`, `README.md`) are updated and remain consistent with the implemented code changes.
- [ ] Run all tests and ensure 100% pass rate.
- [ ] If any test failure is unrelated to your feature, investigate and fix it before marking the task as complete.
